Startup Scripts

Publicly available scripts for on-premise hosted Looker customer startup.

* looker: Startup script for looker.  Should be in the /home/looker/looker directory with the looker.jar file
* looker_init: Ubuntu init file to start Looker automatically on boot.  This may need some customization depending on user/directory for Looker.  This will also need to be modified to work with RedHat-based Linux distributions.
* monitrc: Very basic sample monitrc to manage the Looker process.
